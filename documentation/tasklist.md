## Todo List:

- **Assign story points to each user story**
- **Assign number of hours to the items on this list**
- **Reformat this list so each task goes under a user story**
- Set up use of php on the site
- Make a dummy DB request and display or log the result to prove that the DB is functioning
- Update copyright info with something like: 'SOEN 341 project, Winter 2017'
- Update about page with info about our team, maybe nice button to see github repo
- Create course page 
  - Course documents/materials
  - List of groups
  - List of students (maybe)
  - etc.
- Create group page 
  - List of group members with online status icons
  - List of messages shared by the team
  - A way to upload assignments if you're a student
  - etc.
- Set up some logic in website:
  - Can't get past the sign-in page without typing in a user+passwd then clicking sign-in button
  - Sign-in leads to aforementioned course page
  - Cliking a group leads to group page

**Style anything and everything via CSS so it looks beautiful**

**Hardcode any data as you see fit to make sure we have something displaying on the screen**

*Format the list item with a [strikethrough](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) if it's complete*
