## 10-03-17 Sprint #3

### feedback
- The TA has high expectations for us but is fair, let's all put it in work and take down as much user stories 
	as possible rather than progress in all stories but finish close to none, marks reflect and will reflect our 
	efforts put in.

- Reference every pull request with matching user stories and same goes for projects task and sub-task.

- Update issues' milestones. 

- It was concluded that William, Saishan, Alex and Erdem will focus on front-end while Nick, Mikel 
	and David will focus on back-end.

- Front-end team was bottlenecked by back-end, lack of planning for website infrastructure , but after 
	meeting after sprint #3 things were sorted out. *Front-end plan* to be posted soon.

- **Ultimatum** agreement where back-end supporting many classes and sub-sections is to be finished by next friday
