-Our distinguishing feature is the fact that the TA can divide the class and make the groups himself.

-Task breakdown for every story.
- Be descriptive of who works on what and what does that person do. (see task balance)
- burndown chart
- more documentation
- General website for many TAs to use (approved)
- TA won't look at code but rather test out input and find leaks, flaws in our website.
- **continuous integration** (see textbook)
