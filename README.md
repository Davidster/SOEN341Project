# Our Vision

We are going to build a web platform for students and teacher's assistants to remain in sync during the course of a given semester.
More specifically, this website will function as a way for students to group up with others for team projects, 
and for teacher's assistants to provide feedback for the students' work through a communication-oriented platform.

## Main Features

- There will be a home page for the course in question, allowing the teacher's assistant to upload course materials.
- Students will have their own user account and profile, through which they can enter their schedule for the semester.
- There will be a way for students to form teams with others in a convenient manner.
- Once students are in a team, they can access their team page where they can upload assignments and/or receive meaningful feedback from the teacher's assistant
- There will be a chat platform, allowing for communication in between students, between teacher's assistant and student, and between teacher's assistant and a team of students.
- There will be a way to organize meetings among students, or with the teacher's assistant, which takes into account each member's availabilities.
- There will be a way to track a team's progress and each member's contribution to the project.
